## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

The reason behind these ideas is to fight hunger in India. We want to develop such kind of
application or software that will help a number of people who are below the poverty line and donâ€™t
have enough money to buy good food.

The second motive is to build the software or application which will utilize the food mainly
wasted in supermarkets in India. The software will basically serve both sides i.e. the
retailers and the clients. Both of them will have an access to use the software.
Hence, I decided to work on this project because making a project is not limited to serve a
particular person but ultimately that particular software should help very particular Citizen of a
country and I am looking for the same through my project.

I was interested in the project (Freeware) because it can be even be used by the government
to help those people who are not able to purchase good clothes or better quality foods for their
survival. The government will be benefited from our application as it reduces the time to reach
them and there is no certain need to raise findings for them regarding food and clothes as it can
be done through our application. The necessity is that the retailers and the NGOs should interact
with each other considering their part of the duty.
